# Music Files
Repo for mass reading of music folders and subfolders.

MUSICLIST.py is the main program which is used to run and create the following text files:
- album_files.txt
- music_files.txt

config.yaml is used for configuration of the main program. Instructions are avaliable inside of the file.

ignore.txt is viewed as a list, line by line, for ignoring items that are appended to album_files.txt that are not wanted.
